    <!-- You are building a simple library system. Each book has a title, an author, and a year of publication.
 You want to create a small program that stores a book's details and provides a method to display its information
  in a neat sentence.

Your task:

Create an object named book with properties: title, author, and year.

Inside the object, add a method called getSummary that returns a sentence like:
"The book 'The Alchemist' was written by Paulo Coelho in 1988."

Write a function called printBookSummary(bookObj) that takes the book object as a parameter and displays the book summary using the method. -->

  year: 1988,
  getSummary: function() {
    return  "The book" + this.title+ " was written by "+ this.author+" in " + this.year +".";
  }
 };

 function printBookSummary(bookObj) {
      console.log(bookObj.getSummary());
    }
    printBookSummary(book);
